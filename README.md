# Design Optimization of a New XY Compliant Mechanism

This repository contains the implementation of a novel method to optimize the design of an XY compliant mechanism for maximum fatigue life. The approach combines the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), machine learning models, and the Hunger Games Search algorithm.

## Overview

The project addresses the challenge of maximizing the fatigue life of an XY compliant mechanism, which is crucial in ultra-precision technology. This mechanism is used in applications like CNC machining, micro-indentation testing, and more.

### Key Features

- **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE):** Enhances the sample size of fatigue data for better surrogate modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predicts fatigue life and analyzes the relationship between design variables and fatigue life.
- **Hunger Games Search Algorithm:** Optimizes the surrogate model to find the maximum fatigue life.
